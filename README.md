# VoteLink

### Brief Description

VoteLink was conceived out of the urgent need for a secure, transparent, and decentralized voting system in Nigeria And Other Africa Countries.

Traditional centralized voting systems have often been marred by controversies, distrust, and doubts about election outcomes.

Recognizing these issues, VoteLink offers a solution that ensures secure voting, eliminates biases, and automates result verification through smart contracts.

## Features

- **Voter Registration**: Secure registration, enabling eligible voting.
- **Poll Management**: Admins can easily create and manage polls.
- **Secure Voting**: Votes are cast securely.
- **Results Display**: Transparent display of poll results after the voting phase concludes.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive admin interface for poll oversight, including current status and results analytics.

#### **N/B**: All PRs should be made to the [staging](https://github.com/Ayodeji63/VoteLink./tree/staging) branch

The Frontend project was bootstrapped with [`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/).
